A Python password generator in Jupyter Notebook can be created using the random and string modules. By combining uppercase and lowercase letters, digits, and special characters, a secure password can be generated. The random.choices() function helps in selecting random characters, and join() merges them into a single string. Users can specify the password length to customize security levels. Using a loop, multiple passwords can be generated efficiently.
